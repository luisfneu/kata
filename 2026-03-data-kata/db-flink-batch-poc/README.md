# db-flink-batch-poc

Batch sales-rankings pipeline with **three sources**:

| Source | Description |
|---|---|
| RustFS (S3-compatible) | Daily `sales_YYYYMMDD.csv` files, one per day in `[--from, --to]` |
| PostgreSQL | `source_sales` table, date-filtered JDBC query |
| HTTP / sales-api | Go REST service — polled once at job start via `GET /api/sales/events` |

All events are unioned, then aggregated into city and salesman rankings written to a separate PostgreSQL sink instance.

## Services & ports

| Service | Port |
|---|---|
| Flink UI | [localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084) |
| PostgreSQL source | localhost:5434 |
| PostgreSQL sink | localhost:5435 |
| RustFS console | [localhost:7481](http://localhost:7481) |
| sales-api | [localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085) |
| Prometheus | [localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) |
| Grafana | [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (admin / admin) |

## Start

### Option A — docker compose (all-in-one)

Starts both postgres instances + Flink cluster + submits the job in one command.

```bash
cd db-flink-batch-poc
docker compose up --build          # default: Feb 2024
```

Override dates at runtime:

```bash
JOB_FROM_DATE=2024-01-01 JOB_TO_DATE=2024-01-31 docker compose up
```

`flink-job-submit` blocks until the batch job finishes, then exits with code 0.

### Option B — build.sh + submit.sh (cluster already running)

Use these scripts when the cluster is already up and you want to submit jobs manually with different date ranges.

**1. Start the cluster (skip the job-submit service):**

```bash
docker compose up rustfs postgres-source postgres-sink sales-api sales-csv-generator flink-jobmanager flink-taskmanager -d
```

**2. Build the fat JAR:**

```bash
./build.sh
# Output: flink-job/target/flink-job-1.0.jar
```

**3. Truncate the sink table (optional):**

```bash
docker exec db-flink-batch-poc-postgres-sink-1 psql -U poc -d salesdb -c "TRUNCATE sales_ranks;"
```

**4. Submit with any date range:**

```bash
./submit.sh --from 2024-01-01 --to 2024-01-31
./submit.sh --from 2024-02-01 --to 2024-02-29
./submit.sh --from 2024-01-01 --to 2024-03-31
```

`submit.sh` connects to `flink-jobmanager:8081` via the compose network,
mounts the local JAR, and blocks until the job completes.

**To submit a new JAR version after a code change:**

```bash
# 1. Edit BatchJob.java (or any source file)
# 2. Rebuild — fast on subsequent runs due to ~/.m2 cache
./build.sh
# 3. Submit as usual — picks up the new JAR automatically
./submit.sh --from 2024-02-01 --to 2024-02-29
```

No cluster restart needed. The cluster stays up; only the JAR is replaced.

## Monitoring — Flink UI

Open **[http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084)** while the cluster is running.

| Section | Path | What to look for |
|---|---|---|
| Running jobs | **Jobs → Running Jobs** | Job appears here while `submit.sh` / `flink-job-submit` is blocking |
| Completed jobs | **Jobs → Completed Jobs** | Job moves here on success (green) or failure (red) |
| Job graph | Click the job → **Overview** tab | Shows three sources (RustFS, JDBC, HTTP) unioned into two parallel pipelines (Stream A: City, Stream B: Salesman) |
| Task metrics | Click a task node → **Metrics** tab | Records in/out, throughput |
| Logs | Click a task node → **TaskManagers** tab → select TM → **Logs** | Full Flink execution logs including `[BatchJob]` lines |
| Exceptions | Click the job → **Exceptions** tab | Full stack trace if the job failed |

> **Tip:** Because this is a batch job it runs fast (a few seconds). If you miss it in
> Running Jobs, check Completed Jobs immediately after `submit.sh` returns.

## Monitoring — Prometheus & Grafana

Flink exposes metrics via the Prometheus reporter on port `9249`. Prometheus scrapes both `flink-jobmanager:9249` and `flink-taskmanager:9249` every 15 seconds.

Open Grafana at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — login: `admin` / `admin`.

Two dashboards are auto-provisioned (no manual setup required):

### Flink Overview dashboard

Real-time cluster health. Useful while the batch job is running.

| Panel | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Registered Task Managers | How many TMs are connected to the JobManager |
| Running Jobs | Number of jobs currently executing |
| Available / Total Task Slots | Slot utilisation |
| JVM Heap Used — JobManager | Heap used vs max (bytes) |
| JVM Heap Used — TaskManager | Heap used vs max (bytes) |
| CPU Load — TaskManager | CPU % over time |
| GC Collections — TaskManager | Young/Old GC rate per second |

> **Tip:** The batch job runs in seconds. Open this dashboard before submitting to catch it in flight, or browse it after the fact via Prometheus's retained metrics.

### Sales Rankings dashboard

Business results from `postgres-sink`. Queries `sales_ranks` directly.

| Panel | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Total Revenue | Sum of all `total_sales` (COUNTRY stream) |
| Total Sales Records | Row count in `sales_ranks` |
| Top Salesman | Salesman with highest total sales |
| Top City | City with highest total sales |
| Top Salesmen by Total Sales | Horizontal bar chart, top 10 |
| Top Cities by Total Sales | Horizontal bar chart, top 10 |
| Salesmen Ranking | Full ranked table with salesman ID and USD totals |
| Cities Ranking | Full ranked table with USD totals |
| Sales Over Time | Total sales per processing window (`window_end`) |

### Datasources

| Name | Type | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Prometheus | Prometheus | `http://prometheus:9090` |
| PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL | `postgres-sink:5432` / `salesdb` |

## Query results

```bash
# City rankings (ranked by total sales)
docker exec db-flink-batch-poc-postgres-sink-1 psql -U poc -d salesdb \
  -c "SELECT rank, city, total_sales, window_end FROM top_cities_latest;"

# Salesman rankings
docker exec db-flink-batch-poc-postgres-sink-1 psql -U poc -d salesdb \
  -c "SELECT rank, salesman_name, salesman_id, total_sales FROM top_salesmen_latest;"

# Raw output — all data
docker exec db-flink-batch-poc-postgres-sink-1 psql -U poc -d salesdb \
  -c "SELECT rank_type, group_key, total_sales, window_start, window_end FROM sales_ranks ORDER BY rank_type, total_sales DESC;"
```

Query source data:

```bash
docker exec db-flink-batch-poc-postgres-source-1 psql -U poc -d salesdb \
  -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_sales;"
```

## Stop

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
